# Project-Euler-Problem
Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.[2][3] The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.[4] It includes over 600 problems, with a new one added once every two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. As of January 2019 Project Euler has about 900,000 users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem.
